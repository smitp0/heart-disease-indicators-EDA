    "According to a study done by PHAC (Public Health Agency of Canada), about 1 in 12 (~2.6 million) Canadians aged 20 and older live with diagnosed heart disease. Further, they have reported that every hour ~14 Canadian adults aged 20 and older with diagnosed heart disease die. Although these numbers are very high, heart disease is avoidable and there are many factors that can aid in this prevention. This project aims to identify what these factors are as well as the impact they have on heart disease, to help individuals better understand what things they can do in their day to day life to avoid getting heart disease as well as things they can do to reduce its effects if they do already have it. The data is from the CDC, which comes from the United States, but the overall idea of prevention can still be applied to those in Canada. \n",
